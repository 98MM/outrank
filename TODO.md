# Some TODOs

1. Documentation of the derived heuristics and what hyperparameters mean (3mr).
2. Logging unified
3. Benchmark CI for core components as a regression test
4. Gradual speedups/rewrites of main algorithms
5. Documenting new/extra features (subfeatures etc.)
6. Get rid of Pandas, let's use something more efficient instead
